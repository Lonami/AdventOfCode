# AOC 2017

My attempt at http://adventofcode.com/2017. The `.css` file here is a
hand-crafted version to try to mimic the original site. You can use the
following command to generate a pretty view of the problem definitions:

```
pandoc -s dayX/README.md -c aoc.css -o out.html
```

## What's missing?
* `day07/part2.s`
* `day21/part1.s`
* `day21/part2.s`
* `day22/part1.s`
* `day22/part2.s`
* Second part of the 25th day until the previous are done.
